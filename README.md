The scope of the project was to design a fictional travel website that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination using HTML5, CSS3 and JScript (JQuery optional) technologies. To be included in the site would be interactive features and images of members enjoying the use of member services.
